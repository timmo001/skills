# Write A Skill

Use this skill when creating or revising local OpenCode skills.

## Goals

- Make the skill easy for the agent to select correctly.
- Keep the main `SKILL.md` short and practical.
- Add supporting files or scripts only when they reduce repeated complexity.

## Workflow

1. Clarify the job the skill should do.
   - Define the task, triggers, scope, and any hard constraints.
   - Reuse existing local terminology when the repo already has a name for the workflow.
2. Write a strong description.
   - **The description is the only thing the agent sees when deciding whether to load the skill.** Everything else in SKILL.md is only read after activation.
   - First sentence: what the skill does.
   - Second sentence: `Use when ...` with clear triggers, file types, or request shapes.
   - Make it distinct from nearby skills so auto-selection is reliable.
   - Put trigger keywords and exclusions in the description, not just in the body.
3. Draft the skill body.
   - Start with the minimum workflow needed to execute the task well.
   - Prefer direct rules and checklists over long theory.
   - Keep examples concrete and local when possible.
   - Match instruction specificity to task fragility:
     - **Low freedom** (exact commands): fragile or destructive operations.
     - **Medium freedom** (templates with parameters): preferred patterns where variation is acceptable.
     - **High freedom** (heuristics): exploratory tasks like review, analysis, exploration.
4. Decide whether to split.
   - Keep `SKILL.md` self-contained by default.
   - Split into `references/` only when the detail is large, rarely needed, or has a separate domain.
   - No reference chains -- all supporting files one hop from SKILL.md.
5. Decide whether to add scripts.
   - Add scripts only for deterministic repeated operations, validation, or helper logic the agent should not re-derive each time.
   - If a script is added, document when it should be used instead of freeform generated code.
6. Check integration points.
   - If the skill changes local conventions, update related `AGENTS.md`, command docs, or wrapper commands in the same change.

## File Layout

```text
skill-name/
- SKILL.md
- REFERENCE.md        # optional
- EXAMPLES.md         # optional
- scripts/...         # optional
```

## Quality Checks

Review the skill against these severity levels:

**Critical** (blocks loading or causes failures):
- Missing `name` or `description` in frontmatter.
- Referenced files that don't exist or broken paths.

**Major** (degrades effectiveness):
- Weak or vague description that won't trigger correctly.
- SKILL.md too long without splitting to references.
- Missing scope guidance (when to use / when not to use).

**Minor** (polish):
- Style preferences, formatting, optional enhancements.
- Evaluate whether these genuinely improve agent behaviour before fixing.

General checks:
- The description is specific enough for correct auto-selection.
- The workflow is short enough to scan quickly.
- Supporting files exist only when they meaningfully reduce noise in `SKILL.md`.
- The skill matches current local tooling, paths, and naming.
- No stale upstream or tool-specific instructions remain after adaptation.

## Anti-Patterns

- Description summarises the workflow instead of specifying triggers.
- Monolithic SKILL.md that should be split (large reference material inline).
- Reference chains (A links to B which links to C) -- keep everything one hop from SKILL.md.
- Instructions that assume specific tools without naming them.
- Unnumbered steps in multi-step workflows -- number phases so execution order is reliable.
