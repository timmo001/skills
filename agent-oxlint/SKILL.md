description: Run the advisory Oxlint pass on JavaScript or TypeScript changes in dot-managed repositories. Use after the repository's own lint workflow whenever a task changes JS or TS files; the command checks private opt-in and local Oxlint precedence and reports only findings on changed lines.

# Agent Oxlint

1. Use this pass whenever the task changes JavaScript or TypeScript files.
   Read the repository instructions and run its own lint workflow first.
2. Run it once the change is ready, not after every edit:

   ```bash
   dot agent-oxlint --changed
   ```

   It lints uncommitted and untracked changes against `HEAD` and prints only
   findings on added or modified lines. Pass explicit paths to lint whole
   files, or `--all` for a full-tree scan, only when the user requests or the
   task requires it.
   When the user explicitly asks to persist the opt-in, run
   `dot agent-oxlint --opt-in`. It enables an existing private config entry
   and commits the single-line change through `dot git-commit`, without pushing.
   Missing entries offer the `dot repo induct` wizard in a terminal.
   For agent use, run `dot repo induct <path> --noninteractive` with the chosen
   `--preset normal` (default) or `--preset home-assistant`, `--agent-oxlint`,
   and field overrides from `--help`. Show the preview and ask for approval,
   then repeat exactly those options with `--commit`. Never add `--commit`
   before the user has approved the preview. Resume the original lint command
   after induction. Add `--changed`, paths or `--all` to opt-in to also lint.
   The config must be clean; active commit hooks are refused to preserve the
   scoped change.
3. Treat either successful skip as final unless the user explicitly asked to
   force the pass:
   - the repository is not opted in through private `dot-git.yml`;
   - the repository has its own Oxlint config, dependency, script, or binary.

   Do not bypass either gate or add files to make this pass run. Use
   `dot agent-oxlint --force` only when the user explicitly requests it.
4. Fix the reported findings that belong to your change. Do not clean
   pre-existing findings elsewhere, and do not widen the diff to make the pass
   clean. If a fix would change behaviour or the design, report the finding
   instead of forcing it.
5. Report personal-pass findings separately from the repository's own lint
   result. The managed pass uses only the generic recommended rules.

`dot git-commit` runs the same changed-lines check on the files it commits;
`git-commit` owns what to do when it refuses a commit.

For a repository that should own these rules, load
`install-timmo-oxlint-rules` instead. Do not use this wrapper as a substitute
for adopting the package in a personal repository.
